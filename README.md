# To-Do List with React Native

- To-do list app built with React Native that implements CRUD operations using AsyncStorage.
- The app is built using Expo CLI.
- Planned on adding more features but abandoned because app runs on emulators, but crashes instantly on real devices and I spent 2 entire days trying to find a fix and failed.
